            <h2>#SVG</h2>
            <p> The vectors can be simple shapes, paths, or well just about anything you can do in Illustrator.<br> Itâ€™s an image format that has more in common with a web page that it does with a JPEG.<br> SVG is much more powerful than other image formats we can use on the web as we can manipulate them with code </p>
            <p> Preparing an SVG for use on the web is a simple process and no more complicated that exporting a JPEG or PNG. <br>Work as you typically would in your preferred vector graphics editor (Illustrator, Sketch, Inkscape [free], <br>etc [or even Photoshop if you use shape layers]) with the graphic at the size that you expect to use it.</p>

            <h2>Transforms and Transitions</h2>
            <p>When used together, these properties allow you to create simple animations and add valuable interaction and visual feedback for your users.

                <br>Just remember when adding any kind of movement to your project to keep it simple, subtle, and consistent. <br>The movement you create should convey meaning, always enhancing, not distracting from the interaction for your users.</p>
