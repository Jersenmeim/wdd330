    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Is a way of writing computer programs separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.</li>
        <li>There are four main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction and inheritance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The same process can be used for different objects. Is the ability of an object to take on many forms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Taking the features of one object then adding some new
            features. In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit
            all its properties and methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one. It reduces the duplication of code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>What is a ternary operator?</p>
    <p>The ternary operator is said to be an operator which takes three arguments. is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.<br>The ternary operator is also called a conditional operator.</p>
